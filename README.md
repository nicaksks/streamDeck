# streamDeck
Recently I bought a keyboard with 9 keys to make a "Stream Deck".
Since I live in Brazil, anything here is very expensive, so I had to improvise and built my own.
I took advantage that I'm learning to program in C++ and made this script to open the programs I needed.
I changed the keys from the NUMPAD to it since the keyboard I use doesn't have one. Check the [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/SLkyWT5qbKI?feature=share)

To make the script start when your computer starts up follow these steps: Windows + R > shell:startup > Paste the .exe
